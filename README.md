Data Analytics Intermediate Project
# Predictive Analytics for E-commerce Sales

## 📌 Description  
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict future sales for an e-commerce business using historical transaction data.  
It uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** models to uncover patterns and forecast sales accurately.  
The dataset includes order details, customer segments, product categories, and other variables that influence sales.

## 📂 Dataset  
Dataset used: **[E-commerce Sales Prediction Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nevildhinoja/e-commerce-sales-prediction-dataset)**  

**Features include:**
- Order Date, Ship Mode, Segment, Region, Category, Sub-Category  
- Quantity, Discount, Profit  

**Target variable:**  
- Sales

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data Handling  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning Models  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Understanding the dataset structure  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting Year/Month, encoding categorical features  
3. **Model Training** – Using Linear Regression & Random Forest  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Calculating R² Score & RMSE  
5. **Visualization** – Actual vs Predicted Sales plot  

---

## 📊 Results  
- **Random Forest** performed better than Linear Regression in predicting sales.  
- Seasonal trends and categorical features significantly improved accuracy.
